# Transformer-Wave-Downscaling
Wave height data downscaling from global grid to local grid in Jakarta Bay

Machine-learning approach for downscaling modeling that will use global wave height data and turn it into high-resolution local wave height data using the Transformer model. The local wave data are from the result of the Simulated WAve Nearshore (SWAN) numerical model simulation of the global dataset from ERA-5 by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in Jakarta Bay to train the model. 

DATA
● Global wave data coordinate :
○ 106.00 ° E to 107.00° E
○ -5.00° S to -6.00° S
○ 0.5° grid resolution.
● Simulated wave data coordinate :
○ 106.7654° E and -6.0180° S
